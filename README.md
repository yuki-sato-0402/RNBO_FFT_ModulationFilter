# Rnbo_FFT_ModulationFilter
This is a Filter combining fft~ and oscillator by Rnbo (Max Msp).
I have also arranged the code to use the [AudioProcessorValueTreeState](https://docs.juce.com/master/classAudioProcessorValueTreeState.html).
Built from the [rnbo.example.juce](https://github.com/Cycling74/rnbo.example.juce).  

For *Getting Started*, please refer to the original repository. Also included in this repository is the C++ program output from RNBO in `export/`. And Max patch is included in patches/.
